## Travelog
A digital memory journal for travel enthusiasts. A place to quickly record trips, places you visited on that trip, mark them on a map and add as many entries as you want with photos for that place.

I was inspired to build this project based on a problem I realized I have, which is I have traveled extensively but do not have a way of keeping an ongoing digital copy of the places and experiences I had. Rather than trying to carry around a journal which then ends up in a box somewhere I want a way to quickly record and share what I did in all of the places I visited.
